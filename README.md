# Edit my tilde.club

Hi. I have a [tilde.club page](http://tilde.club/~urschrei).

If you'd like to edit its content, send me a pull request – feel free to add images, JS, and CSS

Merged requests are automatically pushed to tilde.club using GitHub webhooks and a shonky Heroku webapp I wrote this morning.

N.B. Obviously, this is only available for non-commercial content – if you want to pay someone to host something, talk to [~choire](http://tilde.club/~choire).

## TODO
- Pass the sync functionality off to a Celery task
- Do some actual work
