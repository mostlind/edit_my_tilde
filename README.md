# Edit my tilde.club index.html

Hi. I have a [tilde.club page](http://tilde.club/~urschrei).

If you'd like to edit its content, send me a pull request â€“ you can put images in the `img` dir.

Merged requests are automatically pushed to tilde.club using GitHub webhooks and a shonky Heroku webapp I wrote this morning.

## TODO
- make it work for linked js
